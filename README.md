# Backbone Router

Make the app have 2 primary screens, genres and search.
Use Backbone.Router to navigate between the screens (back/forward button navigation and bookmarking must work).
Make both screens have a constant navigation area to jump between the screens.
on the genres screen, have a sidebar with a set of genres (e.g. buttons like "rock", "rnb", "metal", "country") that the user can click and load songs for that genre.
on the search screen, allow the user to enter a search term and display songs matching the search results.
use the following routes:
genre/:genre
search/:keyword
